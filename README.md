# basicauth

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/developermail/basicauth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developermail/basicauth)

Small [Go](http://golang.org) library to retrieve credential information of a HTTP request.
This is a workaround library until Go 1.4 is released, which will hopefully include this [patch](https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6779)

Install it using the `go get` command.

    go get github.com/developermail/basicauth
